A technique where tow variable (pointers) traverse a data structure (like an array, string, linked list) simultaneously from different positions.
[][][][][][][]
i ->    <-  j  Toward

[][][][][][][]
   <-i  j->   Away

[][][][][][][]
i j -> ->     same/fast-slow

Importance of two pointer
------------------------
Efficiently solving problms involving comparisons, searching, partitioning.
